# Emotion-Detection-from-Video-using-YOLO-v8
This repository features a real-time system for detecting emotions from video using YOLOv8 for face detection and a custom deep learning model for emotion classification. It processes both live and recorded videos, delivering bounding boxes around faces and emotion predictions. Technologies YOLOv8, PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask/FastAPI.
